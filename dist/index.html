        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Applied Mathematics and actively pursuing a career in software engineering. 
          The topics I'm most intrigued by are applied alogrithms, artificial intelligence, probability theory, and numerical analysis. 
          In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, learning how to play my favorite songs on the piano, writing code for programming contests, eating yummy food, and playing video games with my friends.
